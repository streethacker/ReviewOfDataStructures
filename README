Simple Description:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In preparaton for finding a job, recently I was reviewing the knowledge of Data Structures.
And this repository will record all my excerses during the reviewing. As a plan, I would 
update the commits every single day.

Implementation:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All of the excercises would be implemented using python. The code-style may not be very pythonic,
e.g. the traversing operation is better to be implemented with python's iterator.
